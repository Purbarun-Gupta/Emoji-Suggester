📝 AI Keyboard for Emoji Suggestions
📌 Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered keyboard that suggests relevant emojis based on user input. For example, typing “happy” may suggest 😊, or typing “angry” may suggest 😡. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a custom dataset of word-emoji mappings to predict the most suitable emoji for a given text.

🚀 Features

🔗 Mapping of common words to associated emojis

🧠 Context extraction using NLP techniques

🤖 Simple ML model or rule-based system for emoji prediction

🎨 Optional GUI keyboard simulation using Tkinter

🛠️ Technologies

Python

NLTK (for NLP preprocessing)

Tkinter (for GUI simulation)

Scikit-learn (for ML model, optional)

📂 Dataset

A custom dataset containing text phrases and their corresponding emojis (e.g., I am happy → 😊).

🔮 Future Enhancements

Improve prediction with deep learning models (LSTM/Transformer)

Support multilingual emoji suggestions

Integrate with real chat applications
