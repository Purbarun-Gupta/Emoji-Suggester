# Emoji-Suggester
This project is an AI-powered keyboard that suggests relevant emojis based on user input. For example, typing “happy” may suggest 😊, or typing “angry” may suggest 😡. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a custom dataset of word-emoji mappings to predict the most suitable emoji for a given text.
